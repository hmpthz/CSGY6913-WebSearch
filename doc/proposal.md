## Course Project: #4: Index Quantization

**Description**

In course final project, I'm going to work on precomputed index score quantization using my own system from HW2 and HW3.

There are multiple approaches for floating-point quantization or compression, including both lossless compression and lossy compression:

- Fixed Decimal > (Var-Byte)
- Linear Quantization bits
- Logarithm Quantization bits
- AdaptiveFloat



**Things to achieve**

In this project, I would use third-party library or implement algorithms by myself. Therefore, my own system from HW2 and HW3 have to be drastically refactored in order to be more generic.

I'll try to find recent papers about floating-point compression and compare various different approaches about their speed, compression ratio and query quality.
